                Aeolian mobility in the Middle São Francisco Dune Field,

                  In the last decade, the semiarid northeast of Brazil (Caatinga
                  biome) has experienced one of the most prolonged and most
                  severe droughts ever recorded in regional history. The study
                  of the landscape changes contributes to understanding the
                  environmental, social, and economic consequences of extreme
                  climate events in the region. Here, we investigate the
                  marginal area of the Middle São Francisco dune field,where in
                  recent years, aeolian landforms development and their
                  migration have been observed. To map the migration line of the
                  aeolian front,we used 2002–2019 high-resolution images, from
                  which we estimate the migration rates and evaluate the monthly
                  migration rates for several interannual intervals,
                  particularly during the drought peaks. In the area of
                  greatestmigration, the dunes advanced 210 m in 18 years. In
                  the first decade, under climatic conditions closer to the
                  historical average, dunes migrated ~15 m/y, while in the
                  second decade, they migrated 80 m at a rate of 9.4 m/y.
                  Examining the ranges of intra-annual migrations, we estimate
                  that the highest mobility rate was almost five times greater
                  than the rate at the end of the decade. In addition, we
                  calculated a dune mobility index and the dune's morphological
                  patterns. <br />
                  <br />
                  We conclude that the morphodynamic processes of dune formation
                  and migration were triggered mainly by vegetation removal
                  fromriver banks. Themore severe climatic conditions during the
                  last drought (2012–2017) enabled the dunes tomigrate
                  relatively quickly. The last fewyears (2017–2019) weremarked
                  by a considerable reduction in aeolian mobility and
                  stabilization of expansion margins, inducing the formation of
                  barchan-parabolic dunes.
