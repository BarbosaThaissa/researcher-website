                A recent review study led by researchers from the Earth
                Observatory of Singapore (EOS) and Asian School of the
                Environment (ASE) at Nanyang Technological University Singapore
                (NTU) highlights some lessons learnt from the event. These
                include key scientific advancements made in understanding the
                tectonics of the region, as well as improvements surrounding
                disaster preparedness. The study, which was published in also
                involved collaborators from National Research and Innovation
                Agency (Indonesia), Universitas Syiah Kuala, ETH Zurich,
                Université Grenoble-Alpes, and University of California,
                Berkeley.

                Recapping the event, the authors explain the nature and
                devastating impacts of the disaster. First, an earthquake of
                magnitude M<sub>w</sub> 9.1-9.3 struck offshore northern
                Sumatra, Indonesia on 26th December 2004. Considered one of the
                largest earthquakes in recorded history, the event was caused by
                a rupture longer than 1,500 kilometres that occurred along the
                Sunda megathrust, the plate boundary between the Indo-Australian
                and the Sunda plates. It generated a tsunami that reached more
                than 50 m above normal sea level in some coastal cities, and
                devastated coastal communities bordering the Indian Ocean. The
                aftermath to the event saw approximately 230,000 fatalities, 1.7
                million people displaced, and US $9.9 billion in damages.

                Beyond the impacts on human societies, the authors highlight the
                effects this event had on the Earth’s systems. For example,
                beyond the Indian Ocean, the event triggered tsunami waves
                throughout the world’s oceans. It also generated acoustic and
                gravity waves in the atmosphere.

                By studying the aftershocks of the 2004 event and the
                earthquakes that occurred in the decades since, scientists now
                have a better understanding of the different tectonic processes
                and ruptures along the Sunda megathrust. For example, scientists
                found that the 2004 event, along with subsequent megathrust
                events including two earthquakes of magnitude greater than 8,
                triggered immediate afterslip on the Sunda megathrust and
                viscoelastic relaxation in the mantle. After large earthquakes,
                the Earth's mantle, which is a layer beneath the crust, slowly
                adjusts to the stress caused by these quakes, causing the
                Earth's surface to continue deforming over time. This
                postseismic deformation due to viscoelastic relaxation is still
                ongoing, even after 20 years.
