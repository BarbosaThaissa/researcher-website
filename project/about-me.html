                      Landerlei Santos is a geologist with a primary background
                      in geomorphology and Quaternary research, focusing on
                      sedimentary landforms and landscapes. More recently, he
                      has expanded his expertise to include near-surface
                      geophysics, as well as research on planetary surface
                      processes. Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the
                      China University of Geosciences, focusing on Earth and
                      Planetary Surface Processes through the integration of GPR
                      data and geomorphic surface analysis. <br /><br />
                      Landerlei Santos obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Geology
                      from the Federal University of Sergipe (Brazil) in 2012
                      and a Master’s degree in Geosciences and Environment from
                      São Paulo State University (UNESP, Brazil) in 2015. His
                      Ph.D. research, also at UNESP, focused on geomorphic
                      surface mapping, sedimentary analysis, and luminescence
                      dating to reconstruct the Late Quaternary evolution of the
                      fluvial-aeolian system in the Middle São Francisco River
                      region, Northeast Brazil. <br /><br />
                      As part of the Latrubesse Research Group, under the
                      program "Large Rivers: Long-Term Basin Evolution,
                      Morphodynamics, and Global Change", Landerlei worked as a
                      Research Assistant at Nanyang Technological University
                      (Singapore), within the Asia School of the Environment
                      (ASE) and the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) between
                      2019 and 2020. <br /><br />
                      Throughout his academic journey, during his undergraduate
                      and master's studies (2008–2014), Landerlei was a member
                      of the Georioemar Research Group, led by Professor Luiz
                      Carlos Fontes, and was involved in source-to-sink and
                      marine geology studies. He conducted research on the
                      evolution of the continental margin of the Sergipe-Alagoas
                      sedimentary basin during the Quaternary period. During
                      this time, he participated in multiple oceanographic
                      campaigns, both in shallow marine (continental shelf) and
                      deep-sea environments (>3000 m depth), where he worked on
                      the sampling and description of sediment cores, along with
                      the acquisition of various geophysical datasets. These
                      experiences laid the foundation for his Master’s research,
                      supervised by Professor Edgardo Latrubesse, which focused
                      on the Late Quaternary history of the Vaza-Barris system.
                      The study integrated multiple techniques, including
                      geomorphological mapping of the alluvial and coastal
                      plains, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and
                      radiocarbon (C14) dating of alluvial terraces, sediment
                      color analysis, and the acquisition and interpretation of
                      Chirp Sub-bottom Profiler (SBP) sections to assess buried
                      paleovalleys along the continental margin. <br /><br />
                      During his Ph.D., also under the supervision of Professor
                      Latrubesse, Landerlei contributed to international
                      geomorphology research projects funded by the National
                      Science Foundation (NSF-USA), National Geographic,
                      University of Texas, and University of Florida. These
                      collaboration research included the study of large river
                      systems in the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon, such as the
                      Solimões, Negro, Amazonas, Tapajós, Beni, Mamoré, and
                      Madeira rivers. He also participated in fieldwork in the
                      Pampean aeolian systems of Argentina, contributing to
                      regional geomorphological reconstructions. Therefore,
                      building a career start with experiences in unique
                      landscapes of South America

                      I am seeking to understand how Earth and planetary surface
                      processes, including those induced by human activities,
                      shape the development of landforms and landscapes. Using
                      an integrated approach that combines Geomorphology and
                      Near-Surface Geophysics, my current scientific interest is
                      focused on the São Francisco Basin (Brazil), the Yangtze
                      Basin (China), and the Von Karman Crater (Moon's far
