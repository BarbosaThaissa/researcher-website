                      Landerlei A. Santos holds a Ph.D. in Geosciences and
                      Environment, with a focus on Geomorphology, Quaternary
                      Research, Near-surface Geophysics, and Earth and Planetary
                      Surface Processes. He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow
                      at the China University of Geosciences. Dr. Landerlei
                      Santos obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Geology from the
                      Federal University of Sergipe (UFS) in 2012 and a Master’s
                      degree in Geosciences and Environment from São Paulo State
                      University in 2015. His Ph.D. research at São Paulo State
                      University was centered on the geomorphological mapping
                      and evolution of the fluvial-aeolian system in the Middle
                      São Francisco River region in Northeast Brazil. As part of
                      the Latrubesse Research Group within the program “Large
                      Rivers: Long Term Basins Evolution, Morphodynamics, and
                      Global Change,” Landerlei served as a Research Assistant
                      at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) at the
                      Asia School of the Environment-ASE and the Earth
                      Observatory of Singapore. Throughout his academic career,
                      Landerlei Santos has been involved in the MARSEAL Project
                      (Petrobras-Fapese-UFS, 2008 to 2014), where he conducted
                      research on Quaternary geology, focusing on the evolution
                      of the continental margin of the Sergipe-Alagoas
                      sedimentary basin during the Quaternary period. He has
                      contributed to international geomorphology research
                      projects, including those funded by the National Science
                      Foundation (NSF-USA), the University of Texas, and the
                      University of Florida. His research has involved the study
                      of fluvial systems in the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon
                      (such as the Solimões, Negro, Amazonas, Tapajós, Beni,
                      Mamoré, and Madeira rivers) and the Pampean wind systems
                      in Argentina, a project supported by the National
                      Geographic Society.

                      Landerlei has research interest in the study of landforms
                      and geomorphological processes across fluvial, aeolian,
                      coastal, marine, antropogenic activities, and planetary
                      environments. Currently I have directed my research
                      efforts towards the São Francisco River region in Brazil,
                      the Yangtze River in Asia, and the far side of the Moon,
                      specifically the region targeted by the Chinese mission
