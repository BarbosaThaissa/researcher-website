              <p class="descriptions-big">
                Aeolian processes and landforms involve wind-driven activities,
                such as sand dune formation and desertification. Extensive
                aeolian fields are sedimentary records with significant
                potential to indicate paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental
                changes throughout the Quaternary period. Analyzing the
                geomorphology of preserved aeolian landforms and their spatial
                and temporal distribution allows us to infer their origins and
                the dominant wind patterns that shaped them. Consequently,
                research on the expansion of sandy deserts makes the aeolian
                record a valuable proxy for reconstructing paleoenvironmental
                and paleoclimatic changes.
              </p>
              <p class="descriptions-big">
                In South America, while sand seas and aeolian fields exhibit
                unique geoforms and show strong chronological correlations with
                other Southern Hemisphere deserts, the aeolian activity record
                remains relatively unexplored.
              </p>

              <p class="descriptions-big">
                My primary research focus in this area has been on aeolian
                records (aeolian fields and loess) in Northeast Brazil. For
                instance, I have studied the aeolian field of the middle São
                Francisco, one of the most significant continental aeolian
                records in South America. I have also mapped different types of
                landforms and evaluated the factors and mechanisms governing the
                formation and expansion of the aeolian field along the middle
                São Francisco River plain. Loess deposits have also been
                described and dated in the Vaza-Barris River. Additionally, we
                have assessed recent reactivation processes of the field due to
                regional climate changes.
