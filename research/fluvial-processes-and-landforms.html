              <p class="descriptions-big">
                River systems, particularly in large rivers (>1000 m³/s),
                typically build extensive floodplains that exhibit surfaces
                configured as complex associations of depositional forms.
                Various geomorphological styles are significant sedimentary
                records resulting from multiple stages of fluvial sedimentation,
                primarily governed by climatic changes, tectonic controls, and
                autogenic processes. Therefore, a better understanding of
                fluvial processes and landforms allows for the reconstruction of
                the fluvial landscape and can provide key information about
                paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental conditions on continental
                areas throughout the Quaternary period. Additionally,
                understanding erosion and sediment transport processes helps in
                better water resource management and flood control, for
                instance.

              <p class="descriptions-big">
                This is a central focus of my interest, generally aiming to
                analyze, describe, and map floodplains. By combining
                sedimentological, geochronological, and shallow geophysical
                studies, I aim to improve our understanding of the processes and
                factors that led to the development of Quaternary floodplains.
                Regionally, studies have been focused on the São Francisco River
                (NE-Brazil) and other smaller rivers in NE Brazil. I have also
                collaborated with research in rivers of the Amazon Basin.
                Currently, I am studying the Yangtze River.
