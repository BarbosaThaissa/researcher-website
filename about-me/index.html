                      I am a geologist with a primary background in
                      geomorphology and Quaternary research, focusing on
                      sedimentary landforms and landscapes. More recently, I
                      have expanded my expertise to near-surface geophysics and
                      planetary surface processes. <br /><br />
                      My academic journey began at the Federal University of
                      Sergipe (Brazil), where I earned my Bachelor’s degree in
                      Geology in 2012. I then completed a Master’s in
                      Geosciences and Environment at São Paulo State University
                      (UNESP) in 2015, investigating the Late Quaternary history
                      of the Vaza-Barris system. This study combined
                      geomorphological mapping of alluvial and coastal plains
                      with geochronology (OSL and radiocarbon), sediment
                      analysis, and Chirp Sub-bottom Profiler data to
                      reconstruct paleovalleys along the continental margin.
                      <br /><br />
                      My Ph.D., also at UNESP and under the supervision of
                      Professor Edgardo Latrubesse, focused on geomorphic
                      surface mapping, sedimentary analysis, and luminescence
                      dating to reconstruct the Late Quaternary evolution of the
                      fluvial-aeolian system in the Middle São Francisco River
                      region, Northeast Brazil. During this time, I also
                      contributed to international research projects funded by
                      the National Science Foundation (USA), National
                      Geographic, the University of Texas, and the University of
                      Florida. These collaborations included field studies on
                      large rivers of the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon
                      (Solimões, Negro, Amazonas, Tapajós, Beni, Mamoré, and
                      Madeira) and aeolian systems of Argentina, broadening my
                      perspective on landscape evolution across South America.
                      <br /><br />
                      Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a Research
                      Assistant at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore)
                      within the Asia School of the Environment and the Earth
                      Observatory of Singapore (2019–2020), as part of the
                      Latrubesse Research Group’s project Large Rivers:
                      Long-Term Basin Evolution, Morphodynamics, and Global
                      Change. <br /><br />
                      My earliest academic experiences came between 2008 and
                      2014, as a member of the Georioemar Research Group led by
                      Professor Luiz Carlos Fontes. There, I studied the
                      evolution of the Sergipe-Alagoas sedimentary basin during
                      the Quaternary. I took part in several oceanographic
                      campaigns, both on the continental shelf and in deep-sea
                      environments (>3000 m), where I gained hands-on experience
                      with sediment coring and geophysical data acquisition.
                      These formative years provided the foundation for my
                      long-standing interest in source-to-sink processes and
                      sedimentary basin evolution. <br /><br />
                      Together, these experiences have shaped my research path:
                      from local studies of Brazilian basins to regional
                      analyses of South American landscapes, and now to
                      planetary geomorphology, always driven by a search to
                      understand the processes that sculpt Earth and other
                      celestial bodies. <br /><br />
                      Currently, as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the China
                      University of Geosciences under the supervision of
                      Professor Zhou Feng, I am combining geomorphology with
                      near-surface geophysics to investigate the evolution of
                      planetary and lunar landscapes, integrating digital
                      terrain analysis, geomorphological mapping, and Lunar
                      Penetrating Radar data

                      I am seeking to understand how Earth and planetary surface
                      processes, including those induced by human activities,
                      shape the development of landforms and landscapes. Using
                      an integrated approach that combines Geomorphology and
                      Near-Surface Geophysics, my current scientific interest is
                      focused on the São Francisco Basin (Brazil), the Yangtze
                      Basin (China), and the Von Karman Crater (Moon's far side)
